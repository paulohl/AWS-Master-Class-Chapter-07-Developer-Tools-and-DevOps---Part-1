reliable and optimized Java runtime environment is critical. Amazon
Corretto, an open-source distribution of the <b>Java Development
Kit (JDK)</b> provided by AWS, serves as a robust solution for developers.
This section provides an in-depth exploration of Amazon Corretto,
delving into its features, advantages, and the pivotal role it plays in
modern software development.
Introduction
Amazon Corretto is AWS’s non-cost, multiplatform, production-ready
distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK). It provides a
secure, stable, and high-performance environment for Java applications.
Available under long-term support (LTS), Amazon Corretto features
performance enhancements, monitoring, and security updates [10].
This distribution demonstrates AWS’s commitment to supporting the Java
development community and ensuring a seamless Java experience for AWS
users [11].
Key features and performance enhancements
One of the key strengths of Amazon Corretto lies in its focus on
performance and security. AWS emphasizes the delivery of timely updates
and patches to address security vulnerabilities, ensuring that
developers can build and deploy Java applications with
confidence<sup>10</sup>. Corretto incorporates performance
enhancements derived from the collaboration within the OpenJDK
community, contributing to a faster and more efficient runtime
environment [12].
Moreover, Amazon Corretto introduces various monitoring and diagnostic
tools to help developers gain insights into the behavior of Java
applications. This includes enhanced thread dumps and a comprehensive
set of metrics accessible through Amazon CloudWatch. These tools empower
developers to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, leading to
more efficient and responsive applications.
Long-term support and version consistency
A notable feature of Amazon Corretto is its long-term support
model<sup>10</sup>. AWS commits to providing updates and security
patches for Corretto builds for an extended period, offering stability
and predictability for developers [10]. This long-term support
aligns with AWS’s focus on enabling organizations to build and maintain
Java applications with confidence and reliability.
Additionally, Amazon Corretto ensures version consistency across
different platforms. This consistency simplifies the development and
deployment processes, allowing developers to create Java applications
with the assurance that they will behave consistently across various
environments, including on-premises data centers and AWS cloud
infrastructure.
Integration with AWS Services
As part of the AWS ecosystem, Amazon Corretto seamlessly integrates with
various AWS services, providing a cohesive experience for Java
developers building applications on the AWS platform. Whether deploying
applications on Amazon EC2 instances or leveraging serverless computing
with AWS Lambda, developers can rely on Corretto to deliver optimal
performance and compatibility [10].
In conclusion, Amazon Corretto stands as a reliable and performant
choice for Java developers in the AWS ecosystem. As we navigate through
the diverse landscape of developer tools and DevOps practices in this
chapter, the significance of Amazon Corretto in ensuring a robust Java
runtime environment becomes increasingly evident.</div>
