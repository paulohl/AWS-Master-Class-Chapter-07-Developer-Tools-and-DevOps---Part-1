management and sharing of software artifacts are paramount. AWS
CodeArtifact emerges as a robust and scalable artifact management
service, providing developers and organizations with a centralized
repository for packages and dependencies. This section discusses the key
features, use cases, and significance of AWS CodeArtifact.
Introduction
AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that
allows organizations to securely store, publish, and share software
packages and dependencies [20]. With native integration to popular
build and deployment tools, CodeArtifact simplifies the management of
dependencies in the software development lifecycle.
Key features and capabilities
The following are the key features and capabilities:</div><ul><li><b>Universal package management</b> : CodeArtifact supports popular
package formats, including Java (Maven), JavaScript (npm), Python
(PyPI), and more [20]. This universality makes it a versatile
choice for projects using multiple programming languages.</li><li><b>Security and Access Control</b> : Granular access controls and
integration with AWS <b>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</b> enable organizations to manage who can access and publish packages
[20]. This ensures the security and integrity of software
artifacts.</li><li><b>Scalability and high availability</b> : CodeArtifact scales with
organizational needs, allowing for the effective management of an
increasing volume of artifacts. It also maintains high availability
across multiple AWS Availability Zones, [20], ensuring reliable
access to artifacts.</li></ul><div>Use cases and scenarios
The following are the use cases and scenarios:</div><ul><li><b>Dependency management in CI/CD pipelines</b> : CodeArtifact
streamlines the process of managing dependencies in CI/CD pipelines,
ensuring consistent and reliable builds [21].</li><li><b>Centralized artifact repository</b> : Organizations with multiple
projects and teams benefit from a centralized repository for managing
and sharing software artifacts. CodeArtifact simplifies the
organization-wide use of shared packages.</li><li><b>Support for Polyglot development</b> : By supporting various
package formats, CodeArtifact facilitates polyglot development
environments in which different projects may use distinct programming
languages and dependencies11Turner, B., &amp; Johnson, L. (2020).
