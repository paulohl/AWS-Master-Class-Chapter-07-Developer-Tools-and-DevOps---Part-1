<h1 data-label="aws-codebuild" class="ltx_title_section">AWS CodeBuild</h1><div>In the ever-evolving landscape of DevOps, a robust and efficient build
process is the cornerstone of reliable software delivery. AWS CodeBuild,
a fully managed build service, empowers development teams to compile,
evaluate, and package their code with ease. This section explores the
key features, benefits, and use cases of AWS CodeBuild.
Introduction to AWS CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild is a cloud-based build service that compiles source code,
runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software artifacts [22]. It
integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and supports popular
programming languages, enabling developers to focus on writing code
rather than managing build infrastructure.
Key features and capabilities
The following are the key features and capabilities:</div><ul><li><b>Fully managed build service</b> : CodeBuild eliminates the need
for developers to set up and maintain build servers. It automatically
scales based on build requirements and provides a consistent
environment for builds [22].</li><li><b>Extensive language support</b> : CodeBuild supports a wide range
of programming languages, build tools, and runtimes, including Java,
Python, Node.js, Docker, and more<sup>31</sup>. This
flexibility makes it suitable for diverse development projects.</li><li><b>Build environment customization</b> : Developers can customize the
build environment by specifying build commands, environment variables,
and build specifications. This allows for tailored build processes
that align with project requirements [22].</li></ul><div>Figure 7.3 below shows what happens when you run a build with CodeBuild.</div>
